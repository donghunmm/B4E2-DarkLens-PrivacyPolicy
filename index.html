  <h1>DarkLens Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="meta"><strong>Last updated:</strong> 19 December 2025</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy describes how the DarkLens Chrome extension (“<strong>DarkLens</strong>”,
    “<strong>the extension</strong>”) handles information when you use it.
    The goal of DarkLens is to help you notice potential dark patterns in web interfaces,
    not to collect personal data about you.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>1. What DarkLens Does</h2>
  <p>
    DarkLens runs inside your browser and analyzes the content of the page that you choose
    to scan. It highlights UI patterns that may be confusing, misleading, or manipulative.
    To keep this useful and safe, the extension only works with information that is needed
    for this single purpose.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Information We Work With</h2>
  <p>
    DarkLens is <strong>not</strong> designed to collect classic personally identifiable
    information (“PII”) such as your name, email address, phone number, home address,
    payment details, passwords, or authentication cookies, and it is not used to build
    a profile about you.
  </p>

  <p>To provide dark pattern detection, DarkLens may work with the following types of data:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Website content:</strong> texts, labels, buttons, links and similar UI elements
      on the page you decide to analyze.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Page structure:</strong> parts of the DOM and basic layout information needed to
      understand how elements are presented.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Technical and configuration data:</strong> timestamps, request identifiers and
      your DarkLens settings (for example language and feature options), stored locally in
      browser storage so the extension can remember your preferences.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    DarkLens does <strong>not</strong> intentionally collect or store as separate datasets:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Account details such as name, email address or phone number</li>
    <li>Payment, banking or other financial information</li>
    <li>Health or similarly sensitive categories of data</li>
    <li>Your full browsing history across sites over time</li>
    <li>Passwords, access tokens or session cookies</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Local Processing and Server‑Side AI</h2>
  <p>
    DarkLens prefers to process data locally in your browser whenever that is possible.
    For some AI‑based checks, a small portion of the page content may need to be sent to
    a backend service so that the model can run.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Only the minimum necessary part of the page (for example, relevant texts and labels)
      is included in these requests.
    </li>
    <li>
      Data is transmitted over an encrypted HTTPS connection in line with Chrome Web Store
      secure‑handling requirements.
    </li>
    <li>
      The service is not designed to single you out as an individual; any incidental PII
      that appears inside page text is only used as part of that page’s analysis and is
      not repurposed.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Retention and Deletion</h2>
  <p>
    Data that reaches the backend for AI analysis is kept only as long as needed to create
    and return the result for your request.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The backend uses the received content only to run the AI model and generate the
      dark‑pattern analysis for that session.
    </li>
    <li>
      After the analysis is finished, the processed content is deleted within a short
      period of time and is not stored for long‑term profiling, advertising or resale.
    </li>
    <li>
      Any temporary logs kept for reliability or security are minimized, are not meant
      to contain PII, and are regularly purged.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    DarkLens does not maintain a permanent database that links page contents or analysis
    results to identifiable users.
  </p>

  <h2>5. How Your Information Is Used</h2>
  <p>
    DarkLens only uses the information it processes for:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Detecting and explaining potential dark patterns on the pages you view</li>
    <li>Showing analysis results and risk information inside the extension</li>
    <li>Keeping the extension working reliably and improving its quality</li>
  </ul>

  <p>DarkLens does <strong>not</strong> use your information for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Behavioral advertising or personalized marketing</li>
    <li>Selling or renting any data to third parties</li>
    <li>Building unrelated analytics or commercial user profiles</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Sharing with Third Parties</h2>
  <p>
    DarkLens does not sell, rent or trade user data.
    If infrastructure or AI providers are involved, they receive only the minimum data
    required to perform the requested service and are expected to protect and promptly
    delete that data in line with this Policy.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Security and Transmission</h2>
  <p>
    When DarkLens sends data to a backend service, it uses secure HTTPS connections as
    required by Chrome Web Store policies on secure handling of user data.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Data is not intentionally sent over plain HTTP.</li>
    <li>
      Sensitive details are not placed in URLs or headers where this can be avoided, in order
      to reduce exposure in logs.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Your Choices and Consent</h2>
  <p>
    By installing and using DarkLens, you allow the extension to process website content as
    described above, to the extent needed to provide the dark‑pattern detection features.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      You can disable or remove DarkLens at any time from your browser’s extensions page.
      Doing so stops all further processing by the extension and removes data stored locally
      by DarkLens (such as its configuration).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    DarkLens is intended for general audiences and is not directed at children. The extension
    does not knowingly collect personal information from children. If it is discovered that
    information from a child has been collected in a way that violates applicable law, steps
    will be taken to remove it.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. When changes are made, the
    “Last updated” date at the top of this page will be revised. If there are material
    changes to how information is handled, the Chrome Web Store listing and/or in‑extension
    notices will be updated where appropriate.
  </p>
