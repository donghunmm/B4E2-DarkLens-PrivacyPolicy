  <h1>DarkLens Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 19 December 2025</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how the DarkLens Chrome extension
    (“<strong>DarkLens</strong>”, “<strong>the extension</strong>”) handles user data.
    By installing or using DarkLens, you agree that your data is handled as described in this Privacy Policy.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>
    DarkLens is designed to detect and highlight potential dark patterns in website user interfaces
    while minimizing the collection and use of personal information. The extension focuses on
    processing the minimum amount of data necessary to provide its core functionality.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Data We Collect and Process</h2>
  <p>
    DarkLens is <strong>not</strong> intended to collect personally identifiable information (“PII”)
    such as your name, email address, phone number, home address, government ID numbers,
    payment information, or authentication credentials (passwords, cookies, tokens), and it is
    not designed to build profiles about you.[web:38]
  </p>

  <p>However, in order to perform dark pattern analysis, DarkLens processes certain data types:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Website content (texts, images, links, UI elements)</strong> on the page where the
      user explicitly runs DarkLens. The extension reads parts of the current web page’s DOM,
      visible text, button labels, links, and basic layout information to analyze potential dark patterns.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Technical information for analysis</strong>, such as timestamps or request identifiers,
      which are necessary to operate the analysis feature and ensure reliable service.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Local extension settings</strong> (e.g., language, analysis options, feature toggles)
      stored using browser storage APIs so the extension can remember user preferences.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    DarkLens does <strong>not</strong> intentionally collect or store the following categories as
    standalone data:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Account details such as name, email address, or phone number</li>
    <li>Financial or payment information</li>
    <li>Health or other highly sensitive data</li>
    <li>Full browsing history (a log of all websites visited over time)</li>
    <li>Authentication credentials (passwords, access tokens, session cookies)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Local Processing vs. Server-Side Processing</h2>
  <p>
    DarkLens may perform analysis either directly in the browser or with the help of a secure
    backend server.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      When possible, analysis is performed locally in the browser and no page content is transmitted
      to the developer’s server.
    </li>
    <li>
      In some cases, to provide AI-based dark pattern detection, the extension may send only the
      minimum necessary portion of the current page content (for example, texts and UI labels relevant
      to the analysis) to a backend server over an encrypted HTTPS connection.[web:38]
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The extension is not designed to extract or target PII, and the analysis process does not
    deliberately identify you as an individual. Any incidental PII that appears within the page content
    is processed only as part of the analysis of that page and is not used to create user profiles
    or for unrelated purposes.[web:37]
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
  <p>
    Data transmitted to the backend server for AI-based analysis is stored only temporarily:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The server uses the received content solely to run the AI model and generate analysis results
      for the requesting user session.
    </li>
    <li>
      After the AI analysis is completed and a response is returned to the extension, the processed
      content is deleted from the server within a short period of time and is not kept for long‑term
      profiling or marketing.[web:39]
    </li>
    <li>
      Any logs that must be retained briefly for reliability or security purposes are minimized,
      do not intentionally include PII, and are periodically purged.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    DarkLens does not create a permanent database of page contents or analysis results linked
    to identifiable users.
  </p>

  <h2>5. How We Use Data</h2>
  <p>
    DarkLens uses processed data <strong>only</strong> for the following purposes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Detecting and highlighting potential dark patterns on web pages</li>
    <li>Displaying analysis results and related risk information to the user</li>
    <li>Maintaining and improving extension functionality and reliability</li>
  </ul>

  <p>DarkLens does not use data for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Behavioral advertising or personalized marketing</li>
    <li>Sale or rental of data to third parties</li>
    <li>Building unrelated analytics or commercial user profiles</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
  <p>
    DarkLens does not sell, rent, or trade user data with third parties.[web:41]
    If third‑party AI or infrastructure providers are used, they only receive the minimum
    necessary data to perform the requested analysis or hosting service, and they are expected
    to protect and promptly delete that data in line with this Privacy Policy.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Security and Transmission</h2>
  <p>
    Whenever DarkLens communicates with a backend server, it uses secure transmission (HTTPS)
    in accordance with Chrome Web Store requirements for the secure handling of user data.[web:38]
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Personal and sensitive information is never intentionally sent over unencrypted HTTP.</li>
    <li>
      Sensitive data is not placed in URLs or request headers when it can be avoided, in order
      to reduce the risk of exposure in logs.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. User Control and Consent</h2>
  <p>
    By installing and using DarkLens, you consent to the processing and temporary transmission
    of website content as described above, to the extent necessary to provide the dark pattern
    detection functionality.[web:47]
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>You can disable or remove the extension at any time via the browser’s extensions page.</li>
    <li>
      Removing the extension stops all further data processing by DarkLens and removes any data
      stored locally by the extension (such as configuration settings).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    DarkLens is not directed to children and does not knowingly collect personal information
    from children. If it is discovered that personal information from a child has been collected
    in a manner that violates applicable law, reasonable steps will be taken to delete such information.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. When changes are made, the
    “Last updated” date at the top of this page will be revised. If there are material changes
    to how data is handled, the Chrome Web Store listing and/or in‑extension notices will be
    updated where required.[web:35][web:44]
