  <h1>DarkLens Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 19 December 2025</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how the DarkLens Chrome extension
    (“<strong>DarkLens</strong>”, “<strong>the extension</strong>”) handles user data.
    By installing or using DarkLens, you agree that your data is handled as described in this Privacy Policy.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>
    DarkLens is designed to detect and highlight potential dark patterns in website user interfaces while
    minimizing the collection and use of personal information. The extension focuses on processing the
    minimum amount of data necessary to provide its core functionality.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Data We Collect and Process</h2>
  <p>
    DarkLens is not intended to collect personally identifiable information (“PII”) such as your name,
    email address, phone number, home address, government ID numbers, payment information, or
    authentication credentials (passwords, cookies, tokens), and it is not designed to build profiles
    about you.[web:38]
  </p>

  <p>In order to perform dark pattern analysis, DarkLens may process the following data types:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Page content and UI elements:</strong>
      The extension may read parts of the current web page’s DOM, visible text, button labels,
      links, and basic layout information to analyze potential dark patterns.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Technical information for analysis:</strong>
      Minimal technical data (such as timestamps or request identifiers) may be used to operate
      the analysis feature and ensure reliable service.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    DarkLens does <strong>not</strong> intentionally collect or store the following categories as standalone data:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Account details such as name, email address, or phone number</li>
    <li>Financial or payment information</li>
    <li>Health or other highly sensitive data</li>
    <li>Full browsing history (a log of all websites visited over time)</li>
    <li>Authentication credentials (passwords, access tokens, session cookies)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Local Processing vs. Server-Side Processing</h2>
  <p>
    DarkLens may perform analysis either directly in the browser or with the help of a secure
    backend server.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      When possible, analysis is performed locally in the browser and no page content is transmitted
      to the developer’s server.
    </li>
    <li>
      In some cases, to provide AI-based dark pattern detection, the extension may send only the
      minimum necessary portion of the current page content (for example, texts and UI labels relevant
      to the analysis) to a backend server over an encrypted HTTPS connection.[web:38][web:47]
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The extension is not designed to extract or target PII, and the analysis process does not
    deliberately identify you as an individual
